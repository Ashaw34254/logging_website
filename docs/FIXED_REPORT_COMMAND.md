# 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING: /report Command Not Working

## ✅ FIXED - New Simple Commands Available!

I've updated your FiveM script to work WITHOUT NUI (web interface). The `/report` command now works with simple chat-based commands.

## 🎮 NEW COMMANDS FOR PLAYERS:

### Basic Commands:
```
/report                     # Shows menu with available commands
/reportplayer [ID] [reason] # Report a player (e.g., /reportplayer 5 RDM)
/reportbug [description]    # Report a bug (e.g., /reportbug car won't start)
/feedback [message]         # Submit feedback (e.g., /feedback great server!)
```

### Quick Command:
```
/quickreport [type] [description]
# Examples:
/quickreport player This guy is RDMing
/quickreport bug Vehicle spawn is broken
/quickreport feedback Love the new updates!
```

## 🧪 TEST COMMANDS (Debug):
```
/testreport      # Test if commands work
/debugreportcmd  # Test report menu function  
/checkreportcmd  # Check command system
/debugperms      # Check your permissions (from earlier)
```

## 📋 TO TEST THE FIX:

1. **Restart your FiveM resource:**
   ```cfg
   restart ahrp-reports
   ```

2. **Join your server and try:**
   ```
   /report
   /testreport
   /reportbug This is a test bug report
   ```

3. **Check server console** for debug messages

## 🔍 WHAT WAS WRONG:

The original `/report` command was trying to open a web interface (NUI) that didn't exist. The HTML files weren't set up, so the command failed silently.

## ✅ WHAT I FIXED:

1. **Removed NUI dependency** - No more HTML files needed
2. **Added simple chat-based commands** - Works immediately  
3. **Added debug commands** - Easy troubleshooting
4. **Fixed notification errors** - Proper error handling
5. **Simplified report process** - Just type and submit

## 🚀 NEXT STEPS:

1. **Restart the resource**: `restart ahrp-reports`
2. **Test with**: `/report` or `/testreport`  
3. **Submit a real report**: `/reportbug test from console`
4. **Check if it appears** in your web dashboard (if backend is running)

## 💡 IF STILL NOT WORKING:

### Check Resource Status:
```cfg
# In FiveM server console:
status          # See if ahrp-reports is running
restart ahrp-reports
```

### Check for Errors:
Look in your FiveM server console for any red error messages when the resource starts.

### Test Basic Commands:
If `/testreport` doesn't work, there's a deeper issue with your resource loading.

The commands should work immediately after restarting the resource! 🎉
