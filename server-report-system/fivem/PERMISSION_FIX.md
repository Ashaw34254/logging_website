# üö® PERMISSION TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE üö®

The "permission denied" issue is likely due to ACE permissions not being set up correctly. Follow these steps:

## STEP 1: Quick Fix - Give Everyone Permission (TESTING ONLY!)

Add this line to your **server.cfg** file:
```cfg
# TEMPORARY - Give everyone permission for testing
add_ace builtin.everyone ahrp.reports allow
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING**: This gives EVERYONE permission to use staff commands. Remove this after testing!

## STEP 2: Test the Fix

1. **Restart your FiveM server** (important!)
2. **Join your server**
3. **Use the debug command**: `/debugperms`
4. **Check server console** for permission results
5. **Try the report command**: `/report`

## STEP 3: Set Up Proper Permissions

After confirming it works, remove the "builtin.everyone" line and add proper permissions:

### 3A: Find Your Identifiers
Use the `/debugperms` command in-game, then check your server console. You'll see something like:
```
Player YourName (ID: 1)
Player identifiers:
  1: steam:110000100000000
  2: license:abc123def456789
  3: discord:123456789012345678
```

### 3B: Add Your Permissions to server.cfg
Replace the "builtin.everyone" line with:
```cfg
# Remove the everyone permission
# add_ace builtin.everyone ahrp.reports allow  # <- REMOVE THIS LINE

# Add proper staff permissions
add_ace group.admin ahrp.reports allow

# Add yourself to admin group (REPLACE WITH YOUR ACTUAL IDENTIFIERS)
add_principal identifier.steam:110000100000000 group.admin
# OR use license (more reliable):
add_principal identifier.license:abc123def456789 group.admin
```

## STEP 4: Verify Everything Works

1. **Restart server** after making changes
2. **Use `/testace2`** command in-game to test permissions
3. **Use `/debugperms`** to see detailed permission info
4. **Try `/report`** command

## COMMON ISSUES:

### Issue: "Permission denied" even with builtin.everyone
**Solution**: Make sure you restarted the FiveM server after adding the permission

### Issue: Debug commands not working
**Solution**: Make sure the resource is started properly:
```cfg
ensure ahrp-reports
```

### Issue: Still getting permission errors
**Solution**: Check server console for errors when the resource starts

## QUICK TEST COMMANDS:

Once in-game, use these commands to test:
- `/debugperms` - Shows your permission status
- `/testace2` - Tests ACE permissions in chat
- `/report` - Try to open report menu

## SERVER.CFG TEMPLATE FOR TESTING:

```cfg
# AHRP Reports Testing Configuration
ensure ahrp-reports

# TEMPORARY - Remove after testing!
add_ace builtin.everyone ahrp.reports allow

# When ready, replace above with proper permissions:
# add_ace group.admin ahrp.reports allow
# add_principal identifier.steam:YOUR_STEAM_ID group.admin
```

## NEED MORE HELP?

1. Check server console when starting the resource
2. Use `/debugperms` and share the console output
3. Make sure the backend server is running (check port 3001)
4. Verify the API key matches between FiveM config and backend .env
