# AHRP Report System - Test Configuration
# Add these lines to your server.cfg file FOR TESTING

# Basic ACE permissions setup for AHRP Reports
add_ace group.admin ahrp.reports allow
add_ace group.moderator ahrp.reports allow  
add_ace group.support ahrp.reports allow

# Alternative - give everyone permission for testing (REMOVE THIS AFTER TESTING!)
add_ace builtin.everyone ahrp.reports allow

# If you want to test with specific groups, add yourself to a group
# REPLACE "steam:YOUR_STEAM_ID_HERE" with your actual Steam ID
# You can find your Steam ID using /debugperms command after adding this resource

# Example - add yourself to admin group (REPLACE WITH YOUR ACTUAL STEAM ID)
# add_principal identifier.steam:110000100000000 group.admin

# You can also use license identifiers (more reliable)
# add_principal identifier.license:your_license_here group.admin

# How to find your identifiers:
# 1. Join your server
# 2. Use the /debugperms command  
# 3. Check server console for your identifiers
# 4. Copy the steam: or license: identifier 
# 5. Use it in the add_principal command above

# IMPORTANT: Remove the "builtin.everyone" line after testing!
